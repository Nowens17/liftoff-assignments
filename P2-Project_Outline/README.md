# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application would be a weight and food intake tracking tool. This application will create and enable a user to log
their weights on specific days as well as track the food they've eaten on those days. The user would be able to create
their own library of foods that could be reused, which would be helpful if they (like me) have foods in their diet they
are eating constantly.

Users will find this app useful due to a simplified interface and functionality. I wanted a nice, easy way to track my
own weight loss and the food I take in without having to fight with a larger app. This would also allow for me to
customize how a user would want to use this app, since I am using it as user myself.

### Features
User Login:
This app already has an add-user feature developed, as well as the infrastructure for a login/logoff function.
The HTML templates for the login page still needs to be written.

Dashboard:
The app will have a user-specific dashboard that is displayed after a user logs in. This will display a large monthly
calendar that will house the days' weight within that respective calendar block.

Graph Page:
Ideally, the app will include a page that has a line graph that charts your date/weight points along a line that is
specified by a custom date range. It will also include a bar graph that displays your most recent weight log against
a user-specified desired goal weight.

### Technologies
I've started writing the back end of this project in Java, with the front being styled with Bootstrap. The application
utilizes Spring Boot mechanisms such as Thymeleaf, and Hibernate to interact with the MySQL database.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I don't know how to incorporate a Calendar into the user dashboard. I believe that I can do this with an HTML grid, but
there may be an easier way that I need to research.
I also do not know how I am going to display either of the graphs that I'd like to incorporate. At a quick glance, there
appears to be some packages that can be imported and implemented within Java code. One such application is Plotly.
